# 👋 Hi, I'm Aryan (CODExGAMERZ)

I’m an **AI & ML developer** focused on building **hybrid AI systems** that combine traditional machine learning with modern LLMs — safely and efficiently.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🤖 Hybrid AI Chatbot with Semantic Memory & LLM Learning

A production‑style chatbot that demonstrates how real AI assistants are built:

* Intent classification (fast & local)
* Semantic vector memory (FAISS)
* Knowledge base lookup
* LLM fallback used **only as a teacher**
* Automatic intent discovery & retraining
