# 👋 Hi, I’m Aryan (CODExGAMERZ)

I’m an **AI, Machine Learning, and Software Developer** focused on building **practical, production-ready systems** — from **hybrid AI architectures** to **efficient, performance-aware applications**.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **theory and real-world engineering**, and I strongly believe that good systems should be:

* clean and understandable
* well-designed and maintainable
* built to solve real problems (not just demos)
* improved continuously through hands-on experimentation

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🤖 Hybrid AI Chatbot with Semantic Memory & LLM Learning

A production-style AI chatbot that demonstrates how **real-world AI assistants** are designed beyond simple LLM wrappers.

**Key highlights:**

* 🧠 Fast, local intent classification (traditional ML)
* 📚 Semantic vector memory using **FAISS**
* 🔎 Knowledge-base retrieval before LLM usage
* 🤝 LLM used as a **teacher**, not a hard dependency
* 🔄 Automatic intent discovery and retraining pipeline

### 🧠 Python Code Autocomplete LLM (From Scratch)

A **GPT-style Transformer** trained entirely from scratch to perform **Python code autocompletion**, using **real open-source GitHub repositories** and **no external LLM APIs**.

**Highlights:**

* Decoder-only Transformer with causal masking
* Custom BPE tokenizer trained on Python code
* Fine-tuned on real GitHub repositories (Flask, Requests, FastAPI)
* End-to-end data pipeline, training loop, and inference
* Runs fully locally on CPU
